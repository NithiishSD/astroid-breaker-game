# 🌌 Asteroid Breaker Game 🎮

Welcome to my first ever coding project 🚀 — a simple yet fun **Asteroid Breaker Game** built using **C and SDL2**.  
This marks the beginning of my programming journey and I’m super excited to share it with the world! ✨

## 🕹️ About the Game
Asteroid Breaker is a 2D brick breaker–style game where you:  
- Control a paddle to bounce the ball  
- Break all the asteroid blocks to clear the level  
- Experience basic physics mechanics like ball collisions  
- Enjoy retro-style gameplay 🎶  

It’s simple, addictive, and a huge milestone as my first college project ❤️

## 🌱 My Learning Journey
This project is very special to me because:  
- It’s my first programming project ever  
- Helped me understand game loops, rendering, and event handling  
- Taught me how to use SDL2 libraries  
- Gave me confidence to continue building bigger projects

## 💡 Future Improvements
- 🔹 Add power-ups (multi-ball, paddle size increase, etc.)  
- 🔹 Multiple levels with increasing difficulty  
- 🔹 Menu & restart system  
- 🔹 Better graphics & animations
